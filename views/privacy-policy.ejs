    </ul>

    <h4>Cookie Details</h4>

It is used for basic site functionality and security. Specifically, we use the session associated with this cookie to help ensure features like the blog post view counter only increment once per user within a given time frame (e.g., one hour), preventing inaccurate counts from simple page refreshes. This cookie does not directly store personal information within your browser, only the session identifier. It is typically deleted when you close your browser, depending on browser settings. While important for certain features, you can often still browse the site if session cookies are disabled, though some functionality might be limited.</li>
